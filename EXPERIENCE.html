   <h2>INTERNSHIP AT USAS LIBRARY</h2>
      <h3>This is where for the first time I did my industrial training or internship at the Raja Ashman Shah Library, Perak. This training was done when I continued my Diploma at UiTM Merbok after the end of semester 3 and then I re-entered to the UiTM to continue my last semester there. During my internship, various new knowledge that I could learn while in the library such as making catalogs via computer, compiling books with the right method, recording materials, and so on. I also did the internship for 3 months and I really enjoyed learning something while there and getting to know the library staff there who were very kind when teaching and serving me while I was there. It was also an appreciation for me because I was able to do something new throughout my life.</h3>
